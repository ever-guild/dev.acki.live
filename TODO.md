# Backlog
- [ ] Review and clarify terminology in the GraphQL schema that originates from TON/Everscale (e.g., `Workchain ID`, `Shard`, `Key Block`, `Split Status`, and address prefix `"0:...`), these may not apply or may have different meanings in Acki Nacki, confirm what terms are still relevant, remove or rename
- [ ] Collect a database of known contracts from their API, especially for system contracts, since they are updated and this database will be necessary to decode historical transactions, this database will also eventually become a contract verification tool; this API can be used as a reference https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://verify.everscan.io/
- [ ] Migrate from Github pages elsewhere because it seems that some users cannot open portal without vpn
- [ ] Make auto SVG to PNG conversion (https://github.com/neatar/dapp/blob/main/package.json#L14)

## Ideas
- [ ] Build own API (Reference: https://tonapi.io/)
